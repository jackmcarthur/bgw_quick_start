# GW calculations on your own materials: quick start guide

This guide is meant to give the reader an understanding of those parts of the mean field -> GW (-> BSE) workflow codes that vary on a material-dependent basis. Before performing calculations on your own materials, we strongly recommend performing some of the example calculations found on the website from our [most recent tutorial workshop](https://workshop.berkeleygw.org/tutorial-workshop/about). When moving on to your own materials of interest, you can adapt input files from the tutorial most similar to your desired calculation as a starting point (i.e. the hBN/MoS2 tutorials for 2D materials, the sodium tutorial for calculations of metals, the SOC tutorial for fully-relativistic calculations...). Some other example input files can be found in the [BerkeleyGW examples repository](https://github.com/BerkeleyGW/BerkeleyGW-examples/tree/master) or even the [test suite](https://github.com/BerkeleyGW/BerkeleyGW/tree/master/testsuite).

There are two classes of parameters that aspiring BerkeleyGW users will need to change for each material considered: **physical parameters** and **convergence parameters**. Discussions of all of these parameters (and most of the information in this guide) can be found in the presentations from the [most recent tutorial workshop](https://workshop.berkeleygw.org/tutorial-workshop/about).


## Mean field calculations

All calculations in BerkeleyGW must begin with mean-field calculations in one of our [supported DFT codes](http://manual.berkeleygw.org/4.0/meanfield/), followed by conversion to one of the BerkeleyGW wavefunction formats, `WFN` (a Fortran binary) or `WFN.h5` (an HDF5 file, which maximizes I/O performance), along with other . BerkeleyGW supports a wide variety of material-specific features found in modern DFT codes, including spin-polarized and non-collinear spinor wavefunctions, meta-GGA and hybrid functionals, and DFT+U.
